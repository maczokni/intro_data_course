### So how to get started?

Topic -> Conceptualisation -> Operationalisation

---
### Topic

What do you want to be able to say? What questions will you answer? 

---
### Conceptualisation

What *variables* will you need to collect?

---
### Operationalisation

How will you measure this? 
What is included/ excluded?

---
### Exercise

Conceptualise hate crime - what is in definition?
Then operationalise your concept - how will you measure?
